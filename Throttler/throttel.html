<!-- 
  Throttling or sometimes is also called throttle function is a practice used in
websites. Throttling is used to call a function after every "x" millisecond or a
particular interval of time only the first click is executed immediately! 


What is difference between throttling and Debouncing in JavaScript? 

The difference between debouncing and throttling is that debounce calls a function when a user
hasn't carried out an event in a specific amount of time, 

while throttle calls a function at intervals of a specified amount of time while the user is
carrying out an event.
